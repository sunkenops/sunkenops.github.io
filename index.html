      <h2>The Goal</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Safe Swim Central! This website was created by Austin Poon, a former competitive swimmer with over a decade of competition history and nearly a half decade of coaching experience. The site was created to raise awareness about the dangers of drowning. Many people do not realize how dangerous drowning can be, as it is often minimized as a rare occurrence and is not taken seriously. Just by being more mindful and more knowledgeable about water safety can significantly reduce the risk of drowning, and Austin feels that this site accomplishes that. He hopes that by sharing his knowledge about water safety and informing people of the true dangers of drowning, he plays his part in reducing the number of drowning incidents happening around the world. Thank you for visiting!</p>
