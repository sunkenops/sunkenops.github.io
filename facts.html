      <h2>Drowning: The Facts</h2>
      <p>As noted by the CDC: "Drowning is the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion or immersion in liquid. Drowning happens when a person's nose and mouth are under water for too long, making it impossible to breathe. Drowning is not always fatal." Due to its potentially non-fatal outcome, drowning is easily overlooked and dismissed as a one-off event. However, upon taking a closer look, it is clear that drowning is more severe than many think. Below are some facts about drowning.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>4,000 fatal unintentional drownings — that is an average of 11 drowning deaths per day.</li>
        <li>8,000 nonfatal drownings — that is an average of 22 nonfatal drownings per day.</li>
        <li>For children younger than 5, 87% of drowning fatalities happen in home pools or hot tubs.</li>
        <li>There are around 300,000 annual drowning deaths worldwide.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Being Water-Safe</h2>
      <p>The term "water-safe" can be a bit vague. What does it mean to be "water-safe?" How do I know if I'm water-safe? How can I make sure I'm water-safe, no matter how old or where I am? Listed below are some of many ways to check your knowledge on water safety.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Via the American Red Cross: "Ensure every member of your family learns to swim so they at least achieve skills of water competency: able to enter the water, get a breath, stay afloat, change position, swim a distance then get out of the water safely."</li>
        <li>Know your limitations, including physical fitness and medical conditions.</li>
        <li>Never swim alone; swim with lifeguards and/or water watchers present.</li>
        <li>Pay close attention to children or weak swimmers you are supervising in or near water.</li>
        <li>Employ the 5 Layers of Protection: barriers and alarms, supervision, water competency, life jackets, and emergency preparation.</li>
      </ul>
